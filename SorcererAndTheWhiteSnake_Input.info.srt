1
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:45,507
Master, where did this blizzard
come from?

2
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:49,672
Don't believe everything you see!

3
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:53,159
But I really feel cold!

4
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:55,793
Then, you're already under
her spell.

5
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,481
I've lost without fighting?

6
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,669
The ice harpy!

7
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:08,737
Wait!

8
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,330
You're no match for her.

9
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:18,477
Now you tell me!

10
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:22,356
You have come so far to find me.

11
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:25,374
Are you not entranced by my charms?

12
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,010
Instead of meditating on your sins...

13
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:29,852
...you are still harming humans!

14
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:33,698
Blame those men, not me!

15
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,755
I was so good to each one of them.

16
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,980
But their roving eyes strayed
away from me.

17
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,542
So they deserved it!

18
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:48,514
You're an enchantress, they were humans.
You were never meant to be together.

19
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:50,665
Today I'll bring it to an end.

20
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,826
Monk, you think you can escape
from my spell?

21
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:58,178
Then come and get me!

22
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,892
Master, have you killed her?

23
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,569
I've trapped her.

24
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,536
Confine her in the Lei Feng Pagoda.

25
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:13,788
Me again?

26
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:15,578
It's me!

27
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:37,582
<i>Jin Shan Temple</i>

28
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:46,593
<i>Lei Feng Pagoda</i>

29
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,982
Trying to scare me?

30
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:04,341
Master wouldn't have trapped you
if you were really scary.

31
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,661
We're giving you another chance.

32
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:13,577
A chance to reflect and improve.

33
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:15,411
If you make real progress in meditation...

34
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,414
...you'll be realised.

35
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:22,357
You, too! Study to improve yourself!

36
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,960
Hey! Hurry up back there!

37
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:42,887
Coming!

38
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,029
Xu Xian...

39
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:59,116
I shouldn't have climbed up here
to pick herbs with you.

40
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:00,768
Be a bit more patient.

41
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,398
Look! Here's one!

42
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,929
Unlike Shennong,
you know the value of herbs.

43
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,052
Xu Xian, you even know which
flowers to eat.

44
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,469
Which flowers cure which ailments.

45
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,226
Do you even know what flower that is?

46
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:16,832
That fool is eating flowers!
They have thorns!

47
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:19,384
He's no fool.

48
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,115
He's not picking
the pretty wild roses with thorns.

49
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,161
Roses are pretty...

50
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:27,302
but not as pretty as me.

51
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:32,912
You...you're more like a hornflower.

52
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:37,747
Blowing your own horn
from dawn to dusk.

53
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:39,724
Hey, don't you even know...

54
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,935
Medicines cure some ailments.

55
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:45,035
But others need liquor distiled
from flowers!

56
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,155
That's absolutely right!

57
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:49,684
Let's keep going.

58
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,447
- Alright
- Climb further?

59
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:59,029
Look, they're still digging for herbs.

60
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,095
They'll strip the whole mountain bare!

61
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,606
I'll give them a scare!

62
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:07,548
What? Qingqing...

63
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:22,890
Xu Xian? Xu Xian?

64
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:05,874
Xu Xian!

65
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,748
He's coming to
Xu Xian, are you alright?

66
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:10,613
Xu Xian!

67
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,396
Xu Xian!

68
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:17,606
Where's that girl?

69
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:19,733
- What girl?
- Maybe you banged your head too hard.

70
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,210
Just now, in the water, a girl kissed me.

71
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,104
She breathed into my mouth.

72
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,961
She saved me.

73
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:30,534
Hey! The one giving you
the kiss of live was me!

74
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,212
Why did you save him?

75
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:44,795
You even gave his vital energy a boost!

76
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:51,082
Hey, I'm talking to you!
What are you staring at?

77
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,455
Nothing.

78
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,776
Nothing? You're smitten!

79
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,014
Master, it looks like
another bat-demon bite.

80
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,795
Amitabha...

81
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,173
- Today is the 15th...
- The day of the Lantern Festival.

82
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,827
We have to find these demons soon.

83
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,803
Or many more people will die.

84
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,748
Amitabha...

85
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:38,573
Ferryman, wait!

86
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:39,836
Here!

87
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,615
We need to cross the river,
ferryman.

88
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:46,837
I'm no ferryman, but jump in.

89
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,116
I hope we're not delaying you.

90
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,272
Not at all! To help others...

91
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,634
...is to spend time well.

92
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:54,095
Thank you, kind sir.

93
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:00,380
Sir...

94
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,278
What you just said
was very interesting.

95
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:06,676
How do you use your time
when you're not helping others?

96
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:09,378
I'm aiming to become...
...a doctor of medicine.

97
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,636
Good, good! Young men like us
should have dreams!

98
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:12,660
I have one too.

99
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:16,467
I dream of become
the Abbot of Jinshan Temple.

100
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,939
And where would that leave me?

101
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:22,072
Uh, Master...that's not...
I didn't mean now...

102
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:23,668
- I mean after...
- After my death?

103
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,682
- You want me to die?
- No, I...I...

104
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,401
That's not what I meant,
Master...I...

105
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:31,898
I assume you're Abbot Fahai
of Jinshan Temple.

106
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,761
It takes ten years of good deeds
for two people to meet.

107
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:36,046
It's destiny that let us to be acquainted.

108
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:41,114
- Young man, you're from Hangzhou?
- Yes, my name's Xu Xian.

109
00:12:41,349 --> 00:12:43,307
I'm a herbalist.

110
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,724
Master, what are you counting?

111
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,055
How long left until I die.

112
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,696
Xu Xian, the weather's nice today!

113
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:55,177
- That it is.
- Don't change the subject!

114
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:57,618
- What was your dream again?
- No...

115
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,343
The ultimate dream.

116
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,186
I don't have any dream!

117
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,876
My only dream is my wish that you...

118
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,050
White, tell us what's bothering you.

119
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,754
Turtle and I can help you resolve it.

120
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,428
What...do...you...

121
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:49,737
I want to visit the human world.

122
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:54,290
You just want to see
that flower-eating fool!

123
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:56,469
I'd just like to take
another look at him.

124
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,317
Look at what? He's just a common mortal!

125
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:03,026
You've been moping over
him for days!

126
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,434
What's this all about?

127
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,840
She used her vital essence to save
a fool who was drowning.

128
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:12,198
- If...your...lips...
- Let me say it.

129
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,172
If their lips met...

130
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:17,860
...there was a flow of vital essences.

131
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:21,660
He's in you and you're in him!

132
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,761
Nothing so serious, I just want
to take a look at him.

133
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:27,769
Don't give me a hard time.

134
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,118
Qingqing, come with me!

135
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,111
Hey, where are you going?
I want to come! Take me too!

136
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:35,289
I will just stay here.

137
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:50,512
See how much fun the mortal world is?

138
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:55,185
In a moment, get off the boat...
...and find him for me.

139
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,832
I'll be strolling around here.

140
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:59,480
When you find him,
bring him to the pavilion on the lake.

141
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:01,858
Why don't you find him yourself?

142
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:05,018
I want to play a little joke on him.

143
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:07,384
And see how nice he is.

144
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:14,999
Master, it's turning!

145
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:16,936
Then don't blow on it!

146
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:19,153
We'll split up to look around.

147
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:20,614
Ah!

148
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:35,719
Watch out!

149
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:37,342
What it is?

150
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:39,073
A demon!

151
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:42,862
A demon? How do you know?

152
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,547
I'm an expert, of course I know.

153
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,632
Are you going to exorcise it?

154
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:53,950
Shh, not so loud!
It's nearby!

155
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:55,980
My Master and I have been tracking it
for ages.

156
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,540
Master says we must exorcise it today.

157
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:00,799
Why do you have to do that?

158
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,254
Demons hurt people.

159
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,088
What about demons which don't hurt people?

160
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,559
I don't know.

161
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,203
- Could you make friends with them?
- Definitely not!

162
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,601
Why not?

163
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:16,091
Master only taught me
how to exorcise them.

164
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,954
Not how to make friends with them.

165
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:25,761
Then your Master has a problem.
Or maybe his Master had a problem.

166
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:31,581
Why don't I have a problem?

167
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:37,272
Because you absolutely don't have one.

168
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,896
You're very nice.
And very smart.

169
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:43,418
I'd like to have a friend like you.

170
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:46,029
I'm Qingqing.

171
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,759
I'm Neng Ren.

172
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,704
I'm busy, I have to go.

173
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,684
Take care!

174
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,603
You are the gentleman
my sister wants to see.

175
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:27,450
Look again, do I look like a gentleman?

176
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:29,359
You have the wrong man.

177
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,937
Can't be...

178
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,674
You're a herb-picker, aren't you?

179
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:39,905
Yes, but I'm not a gentleman.

180
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:43,830
So I can't possibly be the one
your sister wants to see.

181
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:50,562
I recognize you, you're the man
who eats flowers.

182
00:17:50,697 --> 00:17:52,276
Then what's my name?

183
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:54,248
Who am I?

184
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:58,698
I don't know.

185
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,344
But you are the one
my sister wants to see.

186
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:07,006
It's Lantern Festival night,
go and enjoy it.

187
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:08,879
And stop bothering me.

188
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:12,868
Goodnight...young miss.

189
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,568
What on earth?

190
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:32,932
Why is it moving?

191
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:54,626
Stop!

192
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,892
You're a real fool.

193
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:43,067
Where do you think you're going?

194
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,919
Sorry! Sorry!
I didn't do that on purpose!

195
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,102
Sit down.

196
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,019
Miss, it's late
and you're here alone.

197
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:15,940
This isn't proper.

198
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,601
Don't treat me as a stranger.

199
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:21,443
You don't need to be so polite.

200
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:25,420
No, no, I should go.

201
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,522
Who built this pavilion?
It's so rickety.

202
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:31,122
Well, I think it's very nice.

203
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:34,438
And it's a perfect spot
to see the West Lake.

204
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:36,295
I'm afraid I'm not so interested.

205
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,974
And I need to get home.

206
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:40,242
This early?

207
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,908
There's moonlight on the lake,
a pavilion in the moonlight...

208
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,693
And we're in the pavilion.

209
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:51,306
Don't you think it's romantic?

210
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,300
I'm too busy for romance.

211
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,002
What are you avoiding?

212
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,402
Why are keeping such a distance
from me?

213
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:01,026
Why don't you like me?

214
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:04,340
It's not that I don't like you, Miss.

215
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:09,881
But someone else already has my heart.

216
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:20,527
Miss, I'm a very poor man.

217
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,157
I pick herbs for a living.

218
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:26,145
I'm not worthy of your affections.

219
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,590
Then tell me about her.

220
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,874
What kind of person is she?

221
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:39,120
I know almost nothing about her.

222
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:45,649
I can't even recall her face.

223
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,622
All I know is that she saved my life.

224
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:56,162
That day I fell into a lake
in the mountains.

225
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,928
She rescued me.

226
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:07,954
If she saved your life,
you owe her a lot.

227
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,934
But when I revived...

228
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:14,419
...she was gone.

229
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:17,220
My friends said I'd imagined her.

230
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:21,767
But I'm quite sure...
...she was real.

231
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:26,963
Because she kissed me so deeply...

232
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:31,515
That kiss saved my life.

233
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,152
In a way, it also took my life.

234
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:42,802
What if...
You could kiss her again?

235
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:45,485
Would you remember her this time?

236
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,399
Hello, my friend!

237
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:11,325
Oh, it's you...haven't gone home yet?

238
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,677
Done with your errands?

239
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:14,599
All done.

240
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:17,660
It's dangerous here,
you should go home.

241
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:20,579
If it's dangerous, you should leave too.

242
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:23,192
I can't, I'm hunting demons.

243
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:24,773
Know the saying?

244
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:28,209
"There's someone smarter than you know."

245
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:32,027
It applies to the demons too.

246
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:34,516
You're no match for this one.

247
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:37,271
I advise you to give up.

248
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,896
I can't, I sworn to obey my Master.

249
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:43,035
We have to trap the bat-demon tonight.

250
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:48,603
Well, if you want to kill yourself...

251
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:54,468
This is a very, very powerful demon.

252
00:24:57,227 --> 00:24:58,891
Not really...

253
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:02,673
Just a bat-demon which bit a girl.

254
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,782
Ugh, she's all bloody!

255
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:06,083
How do you know?

256
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:09,916
I am an expert too.

257
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,726
I can't let it get away.

258
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:19,660
Sorry we can't talk more,
until next time!

259
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:21,990
No!

260
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:23,639
Watch out!

261
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:29,042
Oh well, there goes another friend.

262
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:31,872
Neng Ren of Jinshan Temple!

263
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:34,857
Demon hunter and enforcer of Buddha's Law.

264
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:39,056
No bluffing!

265
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:46,665
Master! Save me!

266
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,145
Master...

267
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,958
Master! Save me!

268
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:06,221
Master!

269
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,805
Master!

270
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:23,286
Look! Master Fahai and
Neng Ren are back!

271
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:24,982
What's wrong with Brother Neng Ren?

272
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,411
The bat-demon poisoned him.

273
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:28,143
Can he be cured?

274
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:31,831
If he's lucky...

275
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:52,083
What are you staring at?

276
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:54,263
You...

277
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,451
No need to keep staring so long.

278
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:59,881
I can't stop wondering...

279
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:02,469
...if this is really happening.

280
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:06,002
What do you think?

281
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:08,148
That you're dreaming?

282
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,541
Someone once told me...

283
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:16,007
If I want to see someone,
I should keep her in my heart.

284
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,287
Then I'll really see her again.

285
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:22,499
Now I know it isn't superstition,
it's true.

286
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,817
You're saying
you did want to see me again.

287
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:41,103
Xu Xian, let's go on like this.

288
00:30:41,303 --> 00:30:43,529
Always together, alright?

289
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:48,978
Eating together, sleeping together...

290
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,570
Doing everything together.

291
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,545
Won't you get tired of me?

292
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:57,304
Won't you?

293
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,920
But I want to take you seriously.

294
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:06,021
I want to meet your parents.

295
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:09,631
And when I have their permission
to court you...

296
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:15,226
Then we'll have a formal match
and get married?

297
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,239
Brother! Brother!

298
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,000
Wake up!

299
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,457
The sun rose hours ago!

300
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:37,687
Brother, wake up!

301
00:31:37,722 --> 00:31:39,057
What?

302
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:42,072
That's scary, Brother!

303
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:45,026
Brother! You...Your ears
have grown pointy!

304
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:48,262
And you got fangs! So scary!

305
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:52,245
Brother, are you turning into a demon?

306
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:07,732
Master! Master!
Something very bad happened!

307
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:10,273
Brother Neng Ren has run away.

308
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,337
Come end see! Quickly!

309
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:25,130
This place isn't bad,
we could live here.

310
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:27,302
Change!

311
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:35,653
Hey, friend...

312
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,640
You want to hang yourself?

313
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:41,989
Hurry away, friend.

314
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:44,701
Death by hanging is an ugly sight.

315
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:46,163
You'll get nightmares.

316
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:48,714
I know!

317
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:51,288
After death, your body turns purple...

318
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:54,368
Your tongue hangs loose and
your eyes fall out!

319
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:55,715
What?

320
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,145
If you don't believe me,
give it a go!

321
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:10,796
You don't look like
you really want to die.

322
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,120
You don't understand.

323
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:16,022
I'm a demon hunter...

324
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:19,427
...but I'm turning into a demon!

325
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,105
Just think...

326
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,410
When I meet a demon I've hunted before...

327
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,166
...I will seriously lose face.

328
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:30,858
If you're a demon,
just be a demon.

329
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,104
When one demon meets another...

330
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:33,974
...mostly they just nod a greeting.

331
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:37,873
And lots of them don't have limbs.

332
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:40,053
Who'll care about your face?

333
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,891
I'll let you in on a secret.

334
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,520
Actually, I'm a demon too.

335
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,248
You...you...

336
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:54,848
What's wrong?

337
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:57,756
Aren't we the same now?

338
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:01,649
All demons together!
Don't look at me like that!

339
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:05,360
Since we are so close now...

340
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:08,895
...I'll teach you how to be a demon.

341
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:09,957
Come on!

342
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:12,108
I'm gelded!

343
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,838
- Come on!
- A gelding!

344
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:20,135
I just had chive for breakfast.
I am going to throw up!

345
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:26,561
- Bats hang upside-down, get used to it!
- My head will burst! It's full of blood!

346
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:30,366
That will make you smarter.

347
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,424
I have a question for you.
Am I pretty?

348
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:34,910
Listen...

349
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:37,557
Right now, all I can see is stars.

350
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,773
I'm seeing you upside-down.

351
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:44,290
- Pretty doesn't come out into it.
- I see.

352
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:53,216
And now, am I pretty?

353
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:57,119
Seeing you now...
very pretty.

354
00:34:58,352 --> 00:35:03,371
So, do you get a special feeling
when you look at me?

355
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,042
Would you like to bite my neck?

356
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:13,666
Taste my blood?

357
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:21,951
Amitabha...

358
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:22,982
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner.

359
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:24,824
Drink some water.

360
00:35:32,516 --> 00:35:34,006
What's this?

361
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:35,545
What do you think?

362
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:38,272
You bit my neck...

363
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:39,642
...ate meat and drank blood!

364
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:40,732
You violated the Three Taboos!

365
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:42,801
No more calling yourself a monk!

366
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,915
From now on,
be the demon you are!

367
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,722
Liar!

368
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,942
We're there.
Have we brought enough gifts?

369
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:00,530
Stop worrying!
Come on in.

370
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:06,769
I didn't expect your family
to live in a mansion!

371
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:09,319
It's just a broken-down old house.

372
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:12,883
You're here at last!
You kept us waiting!

373
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:17,337
They're all here...
this is my family.

374
00:36:17,526 --> 00:36:18,782
Go on in.

375
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:21,022
- Go ahead
- Thanks.

376
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,278
We need to hurry.

377
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:26,794
They can't keep these forms for long.

378
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:28,158
I know.

379
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:30,722
I want to play too!

380
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:33,501
You can't take a human form!
Scram!

381
00:36:43,629 --> 00:36:45,732
Hello, everyone.

382
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:49,588
I'll make the introductions.

383
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:53,984
This is my father.

384
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,098
Hello.

385
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,489
Sir, my name is Xu Xian.

386
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,218
- He's...
- He's absolutely amazing!

387
00:37:06,753 --> 00:37:09,446
- You're...
- You're just perfect for each other!

388
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:10,797
The perfect couple!

389
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:14,636
- Really...
- Really nice to see!

390
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,015
How wonderful that
you are here to propose!

391
00:37:18,414 --> 00:37:22,241
- Don't worry, he's fine.
- Auspicious day for an engagement, isn't it?

392
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:27,249
This is...my mother.

393
00:37:27,284 --> 00:37:29,484
- She's so young!
- Really?

394
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,316
Actually, my stepmother.

395
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,904
I'll introduce you...

396
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:38,874
Googie...Googie...

397
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:43,524
How come you have a girl's name?

398
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,683
You misheard, it's Gugu.

399
00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:49,773
He was a chubby kid,
that was his nickname.

400
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:52,211
And it stuck.

401
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,865
- Hello, Gugu.
- Let's sit down.

402
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,583
It's this year's latest fashion.

403
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:13,741
This is called Doodle-do Wine.

404
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,176
It'll make you hiccup!
Doodle-do!

405
00:38:20,823 --> 00:38:23,944
My parents like you to look at them
when you speak.

406
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,586
Aren't you here today to propose?

407
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:30,228
Hurry then, we can hardly wait.

408
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,749
I'm Xu Xian,
poor and humble

409
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,117
I never dreamt I'd win anyone
like your Susu.

410
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:52,435
I've come here today...

411
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,694
...because I seek your exalted permission...

412
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,437
...to marry Susu.

413
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,015
Sir...

414
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,219
Although I have nothing to my name...

415
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:05,696
...I love Susu very much.

416
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:10,032
No need for a dowry,
just take her home! Go on!

417
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:13,167
I also want to say to Susu...

418
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,118
Good heavens!

419
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:18,959
Fine, just get on with it!

420
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:21,417
I want to hear
what Xu Xian has to say.

421
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:22,896
Sister...

422
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,754
Speak.

423
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,002
I don't know
what stroke of good fortune...

424
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,913
...allows me to make you mine.

425
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:37,108
All it took was one kiss.

426
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,893
The wheels of fate turned...

427
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,487
...and brought me
to a perfect moment...

428
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:45,033
...of tenderness and happiness.

429
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:48,145
From now on every moment,
every second I have...

430
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,654
...I will spend...

431
00:39:50,715 --> 00:39:52,606
...beside you...

432
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:57,107
To make you happy.

433
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,594
- Why did you do that?
- They're reverting to their true forms.

434
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:13,881
It's bad!
It's bad!

435
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:16,348
Fahai is here to exorcise us!
Run!

436
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:19,242
Run!

437
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:23,345
Get Xu Xian away from here
while I distract him.

438
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:24,690
Take Care!

439
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:31,407
A tawdry illusion to dupe humans!

440
00:40:37,558 --> 00:40:38,648
Send them all back to the demon realm!

441
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:40,070
Yes, Master!

442
00:41:55,894 --> 00:41:57,778
Master!

443
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:02,575
Master, let her go!

444
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,470
Do you know what you're saying?

445
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:08,013
Come back with me.

446
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:10,094
Master...

447
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:14,606
I can't go back anymore.

448
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:27,363
Master, take care!

449
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:10,114
We escaped?

450
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:12,068
I'm not dead?

451
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:15,445
Be calm,
I'll always protect you.

452
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:45,505
What are we doing here?

453
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:47,620
Weren't we getting engaged?

454
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:49,110
We did it.

455
00:43:49,145 --> 00:43:52,528
My parents gave us their blessing.

456
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,112
- Really?
- Yes.

457
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:56,377
That was easy.

458
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:58,444
So now we're married.

459
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:00,862
I'm your wife.

460
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:04,032
We can be together for the rest
of our lives.

461
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,958
One day...

462
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,588
...I'll have my own pharmacy.

463
00:44:10,723 --> 00:44:12,598
Then I'll have more money.

464
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:16,735
I don't want you to suffer with me.

465
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:19,973
How could that be?

466
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:21,804
As long as we're together...

467
00:44:22,439 --> 00:44:25,419
...I'll never know suffering.

468
00:45:04,324 --> 00:45:07,578
What's love like in this human world?

469
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:10,024
What do you mean?

470
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,954
I'd just like to know
what kind of couple we are.

471
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,884
Tell me.

472
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:18,871
Well, there are several kinds.

473
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,637
Some couples are like birds
in the forest.

474
00:45:22,692 --> 00:45:24,483
Each can fly away if they want.

475
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,466
Not that kind!

476
00:45:27,053 --> 00:45:28,277
Another kind is...

477
00:45:28,712 --> 00:45:29,896
...where the husband gets rich
and dreams...

478
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:31,354
...of his wife's death.

479
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:33,243
Xu Xian!
I'll kill you!

480
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:36,387
Watch out!

481
00:45:37,957 --> 00:45:39,037
Don't chase me!

482
00:45:39,462 --> 00:45:42,877
- You'll make me drop the herbs!
- I'll kill you!

483
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,988
This disease cannot be cured.

484
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:58,443
- Master!
- They are victims of demons.

485
00:46:58,578 --> 00:47:04,427
At best, they'll go mad...
at worst, they'll die.

486
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:08,438
While they're alive,
I must try to save them.

487
00:47:10,504 --> 00:47:13,907
Take precautions,
don't go to strange places alone.

488
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,658
Thank you, Master.

489
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:21,191
Where did this disease come from?

490
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:22,968
So many people suddenly dying.

491
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:24,924
You should take some rest.

492
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:26,501
You've been taking medicine
for three days!

493
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:27,795
I can't.

494
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:32,453
I have to find the cure.

495
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:35,533
Susu, give me a hand.

496
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:38,694
It musn't stick...
...to the bottom of the pot.

497
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:43,797
Preserving vital essence,

498
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:44,928
concentrating vigor,

499
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:46,631
boosting the spirit.

500
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:48,398
Aside from these fundamentals...

501
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:51,794
...the medicine must strenghten
basic functions.

502
00:47:52,264 --> 00:47:54,303
This is such a fierce disease.

503
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,214
Can this medicine work?

504
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,493
I don't really know.

505
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:07,131
Woman...

506
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:53,313
Disciples!

507
00:49:29,324 --> 00:49:32,416
Foul demons!
Crossing the three realms and five planes...

508
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:35,811
...you harmed the people
and spread chaos and evil!

509
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:38,553
By Buddha's mercy,
if you choose to repent...

510
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:41,226
...you still have a chance to live.

511
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:45,859
We'd rather die than listen to your nonsense!

512
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:16,555
Beware!
The fox-demons are casting a charm!

513
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:18,723
- On guard!
- Yes, Master!

514
00:50:21,816 --> 00:50:23,485
Maximum protection shield!

515
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,087
Heaven needs no hearing ecstasy,
needs no sight.

516
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:29,624
Void my sense of self.

517
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,248
What's that mantra?

518
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:17,642
Is it real or are you making it up?

519
00:51:28,772 --> 00:51:30,435
Show your real forms!

520
00:51:57,271 --> 00:51:58,988
By heaven's mercy.

521
00:51:59,223 --> 00:52:01,413
Master, we regret our sin.

522
00:52:01,548 --> 00:52:03,887
Please let us go.
We beg you.

523
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:06,176
Silence!
You are demons!

524
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:08,323
Return to the six oaths of transmigration!

525
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,759
Accept your punishment with humility!

526
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:13,790
Amitabha...

527
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,056
Sister, Sister.

528
00:52:30,091 --> 00:52:33,070
What's wrong?
Are you alright?

529
00:52:35,055 --> 00:52:36,090
It's nothing.

530
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:37,711
That's impossible...

531
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,255
If you keep on like this...

532
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,799
...something will go very wrong.

533
00:52:42,834 --> 00:52:44,698
I know what I'm doing.

534
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:47,094
All you care about is that Xu Xian.

535
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:48,848
Adding your vital essence to
that medicine...

536
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:52,176
...is costing you centuries of
self-improvement.

537
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,468
I don't want to see him work so hard.
I want to help him.

538
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:59,382
But you may not live to see him again!

539
00:52:59,617 --> 00:53:02,549
- It can't be that bad.
- Of course it is.

540
00:53:02,584 --> 00:53:04,551
I have to go.

541
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,882
Wait!

542
00:53:10,152 --> 00:53:13,907
- Ah, Dr. Xu is here.
- Dr. Xu, thank you!

543
00:53:14,097 --> 00:53:17,750
- You're truly our savior.
- We owe you our lives.

544
00:53:18,185 --> 00:53:21,271
You and your wife are such good people.

545
00:53:22,003 --> 00:53:24,020
Don't rush.

546
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:27,048
There's enough for everyone.

547
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:28,940
Thank you.

548
00:53:29,554 --> 00:53:31,468
Master, you should take some too.

549
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:34,799
It cures sickness and
prevents infection.

550
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,706
Thank you.

551
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:43,239
Master...

552
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:44,601
Did you mix this medicine?

553
00:53:44,636 --> 00:53:45,798
Yes.

554
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:49,397
- No one helped you?
- Yes, my wife did.

555
00:53:49,732 --> 00:53:52,522
You are the quintessence of benevolence.

556
00:53:52,757 --> 00:53:55,801
Take this spirit dagger
as a token of thanks.

557
00:53:55,886 --> 00:53:57,819
I can't, Master.
I'm just doing my duty.

558
00:53:57,904 --> 00:53:59,827
You shouldn't refuse a gift
from a senior.

559
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,994
Keep it to protect yourself.

560
00:54:03,183 --> 00:54:05,670
Thank you, Master.

561
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,958
Amitabha...

562
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:40,437
You think you can run?

563
00:55:36,439 --> 00:55:39,363
You made the cure for
the fox-demon's poison.

564
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:41,211
So what?

565
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:44,627
Making it has cost you centuries of
vital essence.

566
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,484
You're kind to the ordinary people.

567
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:52,189
But in your eyes,
all we do is harm people.

568
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,827
Despite good intentions,
you will harm someone.

569
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:56,012
Who will I harm?

570
00:55:56,047 --> 00:55:57,367
You should know that.

571
00:55:57,797 --> 00:56:00,429
Xu Xian is my true love,
how could I harm him?

572
00:56:00,664 --> 00:56:03,068
You're from different realms!
Being together...

573
00:56:03,103 --> 00:56:05,481
...you drain his life-force and
distort his destiny.

574
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:08,785
Human lives are short,
and true love is rare.

575
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,953
He didn't choose to love you,
you took his love.

576
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:14,567
What does that matter?
He's happy with me.

577
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:16,844
Go chant your sutras!

578
00:56:16,879 --> 00:56:19,738
You know nothing of love.

579
00:56:21,033 --> 00:56:23,111
If Xu Xian knew you are a snake...

580
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,867
...would he still love you?

581
00:56:29,863 --> 00:56:32,806
I truly love him.

582
00:56:35,857 --> 00:56:38,517
If that's the case,
shed your own tears.

583
00:56:38,852 --> 00:56:41,293
Don't make him shed tears over you.

584
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,589
Since you're so benevolent...

585
00:56:48,824 --> 00:56:51,272
...I'll let you go this time.

586
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:56,505
If I see you again in this realm,
there'll be no mercy.

587
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,205
Susu, I'm home.

588
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:22,984
So soon?

589
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:26,686
You're back ...

590
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:29,358
Look!

591
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,015
What's special about today?

592
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:33,143
Well, everyone else...

593
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:34,527
...is celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival.

594
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:35,561
While I'm celebrating...

595
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:37,900
...the best day I've ever had!

596
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:41,905
The day my medicine cured everyone!

597
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,746
- Really?
- Yes.

598
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:45,550
That's wonderful.

599
00:57:45,684 --> 00:57:49,476
The old villagers were so grateful.
They gave us all this food.

600
00:57:49,611 --> 00:57:52,719
Susu, thank you for working
so hard.

601
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:56,048
Here, a toast to you.

602
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:07,135
I'm hungry.
Here, try this.

603
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,905
It's good.

604
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,505
You have some too.

605
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:21,282
What's wrong?

606
00:58:23,592 --> 00:58:25,138
What kind of wine is this?

607
00:58:25,173 --> 00:58:27,989
They distiled it themselves.

608
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:30,898
Sulphur-flower wine!

609
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:31,781
That's right.

610
00:58:32,068 --> 00:58:36,701
It's a festival tradition,
it wards off snake bites.

611
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:39,806
Susu?

612
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:43,373
What's wrong?
Susu!

613
00:58:43,835 --> 00:58:46,700
Susu? Susu?
What's the matter?

614
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,124
Are you alright?

615
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:49,933
I'm alright.

616
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,690
Susu!

617
00:58:52,314 --> 00:58:55,019
Why lock the door?
Open it!

618
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:56,077
Susu...

619
00:58:56,262 --> 00:58:58,423
Don't frighten me!

620
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:00,312
Susu...

621
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:03,686
What's the matter?

622
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:05,115
Susu!

623
00:59:05,624 --> 00:59:08,053
Susu!

624
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,737
Susu!

625
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:24,594
Susu, what are you doing?

626
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:26,497
Open the door!

627
00:59:26,636 --> 00:59:29,640
Susu, don't frighten me!

628
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:31,840
Xu Xian...

629
00:59:31,976 --> 00:59:33,488
Do you recall...

630
00:59:34,122 --> 00:59:36,471
...what you said to me
when you proposed?

631
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:39,157
I want to hear you saying it again.

632
00:59:40,255 --> 00:59:42,894
I knew you were playing
a trick on me!

633
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:44,724
I'd rather not repeat it.

634
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:46,975
If you don't...

635
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:48,799
...I might never hear it again.

636
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:52,035
Alright, alright
I'll say it.

637
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,565
But then you must open the door!

638
00:59:56,657 --> 01:00:00,018
Alright.

639
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:04,980
"All it took was one kiss."

640
01:00:05,215 --> 01:00:08,813
"I'm sure that the wheels of
fate turned..."

641
01:00:09,558 --> 01:00:12,131
"...and brought me to a perfect moment..."

642
01:00:12,466 --> 01:00:16,887
"...of tenderness and happiness."

643
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,965
"From now on..."

644
01:00:21,394 --> 01:00:24,392
"...every moment,
every second I have..."

645
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:28,587
"...I will spend beside you..."

646
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:34,491
"...to make you happy."

647
01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:41,098
Susu! Susu!

648
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:44,128
Open the door, Susu!

649
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:51,256
I gave you a chance.

650
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:53,302
You didn't leave,
so now I must take you.

651
01:00:53,437 --> 01:00:56,991
Monk...Why are you intent on
destroying our happiness?

652
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,489
Susu! Who are you talking to?

653
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:49,678
Don't chase her!

654
01:01:50,213 --> 01:01:51,538
She was stabbed with the spirit dagger.

655
01:01:51,573 --> 01:01:54,832
Losing vital essence,
she can't take human form.

656
01:01:55,456 --> 01:01:59,050
Master, where is my wife?

657
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:02,126
Did the white snake eat her?

658
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:04,203
The white snake was your wife.

659
01:02:04,238 --> 01:02:07,423
You married a thousand-year-old snake demon.

660
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:12,633
Impossible!

661
01:02:15,221 --> 01:02:17,156
Impossible!

662
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:21,319
- Impossible!
- Amitabha...

663
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:11,651
Sister, I'll give you some of
my vital essence.

664
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:15,201
It's no use.

665
01:03:17,203 --> 01:03:21,643
You have only a few centuries' worth.

666
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:27,629
That spirit dagger had thousands!

667
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:33,966
We were wrong to come here.

668
01:03:34,386 --> 01:03:39,038
It wasn't worth it,
to see you like this.

669
01:03:43,522 --> 01:03:46,401
Maybe I shouldn't have done it...

670
01:03:48,775 --> 01:03:51,509
But I have no regrets.

671
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:57,087
Only now do I know...

672
01:03:57,847 --> 01:04:00,845
...what true love is.

673
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:05,905
Love...

674
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:09,097
Is it really so important?

675
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,864
Tell me...

676
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:17,960
How can I save Susu?

677
01:04:19,027 --> 01:04:20,709
The one thing that might is spirit herb.

678
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,921
It can bring the dead back to life.

679
01:04:22,932 --> 01:04:28,032
It only grows in the Lei Feng Pagoda.

680
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:31,024
A demon like me can't even get in there!

681
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,118
Plus, there is only a single sprout.

682
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:38,278
It is really, really scary.
They say fire can't even burn it!

683
01:04:39,153 --> 01:04:42,130
Even if it takes braving swords and
seas of fire...

684
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:45,676
...I shall save Susu.

685
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,089
I can't take you any further.

686
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:59,288
You dare to steal the spirit herb? Thief!

687
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:16,752
Which is the real spirit herb?

688
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:20,292
You will know after your death.

689
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:24,245
I'll find it even if it kills me!

690
01:07:25,828 --> 01:07:28,741
I must save Susu!

691
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:40,213
There's only a single sprout.
Fire can't even burn it!

692
01:09:11,593 --> 01:09:13,043
They found us!

693
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:24,831
- Did you get the spirit herb?
- I did.

694
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:26,258
Then let's get out of here!

695
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,355
It is going to be disaster
if they catch you.

696
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,928
You take the spirit herb,
I'll distract them.

697
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:08,326
Demons have been confined in
Lei Feng Pagoda for aeons!

698
01:10:08,861 --> 01:10:11,059
The spirit herb kept them trapped.

699
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:14,231
Your theft has caused a catastrophe!

700
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:18,046
Let me go!
Why are you keeping me here?

701
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:19,743
I needed to save her!

702
01:10:19,978 --> 01:10:21,479
I wounded Susu.

703
01:10:21,514 --> 01:10:24,798
Master, let me go!
Let me go!

704
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:27,196
I wounded Susu.

705
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:32,667
Master, we can't hold them much longer.

706
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:35,056
Call all the senior monks, now!

707
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:37,474
We'll cast the Luohan spell!

708
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:46,345
I got spirit herb!

709
01:10:49,886 --> 01:10:52,051
Spirit herb?
From where?

710
01:10:52,185 --> 01:10:54,219
Xu Xian gave it to me.

711
01:10:55,015 --> 01:10:56,182
Where is he?

712
01:10:57,436 --> 01:11:00,216
The monks took him.

713
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:40,257
Disciples!

714
01:11:40,432 --> 01:11:43,514
Seal the main hall
with a maximum protection spell!

715
01:11:52,219 --> 01:11:53,853
Maximum protection in force!

716
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:57,619
Now we cast the spell!

717
01:11:57,654 --> 01:12:00,352
Any interruption will kill him!

718
01:12:30,718 --> 01:12:33,390
Leave! You trespass on hallowed ground!

719
01:12:33,425 --> 01:12:35,271
Fahai, give me Xu Xian!

720
01:12:35,406 --> 01:12:38,124
You should be thankful you aren't dead.

721
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,829
Why this further trouble?

722
01:12:39,924 --> 01:12:42,645
Release him and I'll go at once.

723
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:44,817
He stole the spirit herb for you.

724
01:12:44,852 --> 01:12:47,157
He's in great danger
because evil spirits possessed him!

725
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:49,995
Now we're breaking your spell!

726
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:52,602
I possessed him?
That cannot be...

727
01:12:52,697 --> 01:12:53,768
I want to see him.

728
01:12:53,843 --> 01:12:57,071
He's in a life-or-death struggle.
Interrupting the ritual...

729
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,518
...will end his life...

730
01:12:58,553 --> 01:13:01,281
...and threaten those around him.

731
01:13:01,616 --> 01:13:04,603
Relations between humans and demons
can bring no good.

732
01:13:04,738 --> 01:13:05,927
You...

733
01:13:06,062 --> 01:13:09,635
You're just coming between
my sister and Xu Xian!

734
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,156
If you won't release him,
I'll fight you!

735
01:14:15,638 --> 01:14:18,769
If I don't leave with Xu Xian,
I'll flood Jinshan!

736
01:14:18,804 --> 01:14:22,309
You are selfish! How many lives
will you threaten?

737
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:26,104
I will be force to put an end
to you unless you stop.

738
01:14:26,139 --> 01:14:30,059
Very well...
You're forcing me!

739
01:15:50,394 --> 01:15:52,808
Get the important ones first!

740
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:54,824
Quick!

741
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:44,487
Forward, brothers!
Charge!

742
01:18:47,518 --> 01:18:50,086
Bite them!
Break their human chain!

743
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,059
Xu Xian! Xu Xian!

744
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:53,849
Xu Xian?

745
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:56,187
You...

746
01:19:57,739 --> 01:19:59,668
It's me, Susu.

747
01:20:00,032 --> 01:20:01,454
Susu?

748
01:20:06,909 --> 01:20:09,593
Who is Susu?

749
01:20:14,914 --> 01:20:17,482
I'm your wife.

750
01:20:18,157 --> 01:20:19,963
When did I get married?

751
01:20:20,538 --> 01:20:23,149
Do you remember how we met?

752
01:20:25,298 --> 01:20:26,378
I...

753
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:36,646
Fahai, what horrible magic did you use
to make him forget me?

754
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,385
As I told you, evil spirits possessed him.

755
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,697
You broke in and disrupted the
Luohan spell!

756
01:20:42,732 --> 01:20:46,064
You're the one who's harmed Xu Xian!

757
01:20:46,098 --> 01:20:49,825
What Luohan spell?
What possession?

758
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,117
You're making it up!

759
01:20:52,152 --> 01:20:55,080
You just want Xu Xian to leave me.

760
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:57,435
You're a monster!

761
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:22,129
Qingqing!

762
01:23:21,945 --> 01:23:23,400
Brother Neng Ren!

763
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:35,360
Brother Neng Ren!

764
01:23:47,182 --> 01:23:49,187
I've been a dharma defender all my life...

765
01:23:49,522 --> 01:23:51,849
...to maintain natural order and
ethical conduct.

766
01:23:52,482 --> 01:23:56,280
Why did the calamity happen instead?

767
01:23:57,815 --> 01:24:00,237
Have I been too stubborn?

768
01:24:03,008 --> 01:24:05,788
Was I really wrong?

769
01:24:32,295 --> 01:24:34,758
Why is it...

770
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,761
...that every time I wake up...

771
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:42,789
...you're beside me?

772
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:10,301
Open the door!
Let me out!

773
01:28:10,837 --> 01:28:13,237
Let me see Xu Xian one more time!

774
01:28:13,472 --> 01:28:17,387
I don't care if you turn me to dust
and scatter me.

775
01:28:28,402 --> 01:28:32,315
The love we had...
Was it not real?

776
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:39,262
Where is all your great benevolence now?

777
01:28:46,892 --> 01:28:49,857
Can't we see each other
just one more?

778
01:28:54,518 --> 01:28:56,703
Just once...

779
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,651
I'll accept my punishment.

780
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:15,660
Amitabha...

781
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:42,666
Your mercy is boundless...

782
01:29:44,144 --> 01:29:46,312
I understand...

783
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:50,036
Amitabha...

784
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,903
Xu Xian!

785
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:28,170
You're suffering...

786
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:31,334
I don't recognize you...

787
01:30:32,395 --> 01:30:34,693
...but for some reason I don't understand...

788
01:30:35,927 --> 01:30:39,413
...when I see you shedding tears...

789
01:30:39,657 --> 01:30:41,752
...my heart aches for you.

790
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:52,159
Don't be upset,
I don't want you to cry.

791
01:30:52,942 --> 01:30:55,708
I'll cry for both of us.

792
01:30:56,583 --> 01:31:00,916
I don't mind that you've forgotten me.

793
01:31:02,357 --> 01:31:05,194
My own memories are enough.

794
01:31:05,595 --> 01:31:08,626
Before I first saw you...

795
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:11,711
...I meditated for a thousand years.

796
01:31:13,524 --> 01:31:15,687
But those thousand years...

797
01:31:17,211 --> 01:31:21,701
...were worth less than a moment with you.

798
01:31:23,534 --> 01:31:25,798
You'll never know...

799
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:32,662
...how I've had to suffer.

800
01:31:32,897 --> 01:31:35,627
But even if I die...

801
01:31:36,619 --> 01:31:39,342
...I'll have no regrets.

802
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:26,418
Susu...

803
01:32:37,162 --> 01:32:41,291
<i>Your hair tickles my heart</i>

804
01:32:41,292 --> 01:32:44,055
<i>Your eyes lingers in my mind</i>

805
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:47,835
<i>I can bear any hardships to be with you</i>

806
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:52,203
<i>Our love shall remain in the dark</i>

807
01:32:52,438 --> 01:32:55,205
<i>year after year</i>

808
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,084
<i>but nothing can change it</i>

809
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:58,222
<i>Nothing at all</i>

810
01:32:58,482 --> 01:33:00,501
<i>I will be there</i>

811
01:33:00,636 --> 01:33:03,217
<i>If you are there</i>

812
01:33:03,553 --> 01:33:10,037
<i>I vow to live for you</i>

813
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:16,853
<i>Because I can lose anthing but you</i>

814
01:33:16,988 --> 01:33:19,646
<i>Love is right</i>

815
01:33:19,881 --> 01:33:23,645
<i>If there is joy between us</i>

816
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:26,884
<i>Our love shall survive</i>

817
01:33:26,919 --> 01:33:30,850
<i>longer than any time</i>

818
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:36,267
<i>I vow to live for you</i>

819
01:33:36,302 --> 01:33:38,098
<i>till the end of time</i>

820
01:33:38,133 --> 01:33:43,310
<i>Because I can lose anything but you</i>

821
01:33:43,445 --> 01:33:47,388
<i>Love is right</i>

822
01:33:47,424 --> 01:33:51,171
<i>If the tortures on me are to
protect you</i>

823
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:54,204
<i>Our love shall survive</i>

824
01:33:54,339 --> 01:33:59,134
<i>longer than any time</i>

825
01:33:59,537 --> 01:34:05,133
<i>And we'll meet again in our next lives</i>

826
01:34:08,775 --> 01:34:10,349
Susu...

827
01:34:19,652 --> 01:34:25,097
For the two of them, that was probably
the best outcome.

828
01:34:27,331 --> 01:34:31,701
I never want to love anyone
as she loved him.

829
01:34:31,736 --> 01:34:36,892
You...you'll never be much good
as a demon.

830
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,705
Neng Ren...

831
01:35:38,005 --> 01:35:39,551
that new form you have...

832
01:35:40,037 --> 01:35:41,637
It kind of suits you.
