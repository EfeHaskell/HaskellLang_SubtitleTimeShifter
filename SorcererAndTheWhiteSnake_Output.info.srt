1
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,507
Master, where did this blizzard come from?

2
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:42,672
Don't believe everything you see!

3
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:46,159
But I really feel cold!

4
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,793
Then, you're already under her spell.

5
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,481
I've lost without fighting?

6
00:00:59,497 --> 00:01:00,669
The ice harpy!

7
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:01,737
Wait!

8
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,330
You're no match for her.

9
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:11,477
Now you tell me!

10
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:15,356
You have come so far to find me.

11
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:18,374
Are you not entranced by my charms?

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,010
Instead of meditating on your sins...

13
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,852
...you are still harming humans!

14
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:26,698
Blame those men, not me!

15
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,755
I was so good to each one of them.

16
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,980
But their roving eyes strayed away from me.

17
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:37,542
So they deserved it!

18
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:41,514
You're an enchantress, they were humans. You were never meant to be together.

19
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:43,665
Today I'll bring it to an end.

20
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,826
Monk, you think you can escape from my spell?

21
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,178
Then come and get me!

22
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,892
Master, have you killed her?

23
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,569
I've trapped her.

24
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,536
Confine her in the Lei Feng Pagoda.

25
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:06,788
Me again?

26
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:08,578
It's me!

27
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:30,582
<i>Jin Shan Temple</i>

28
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:39,593
<i>Lei Feng Pagoda</i>

29
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:52,982
Trying to scare me?

30
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:57,341
Master wouldn't have trapped you if you were really scary.

31
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,661
We're giving you another chance.

32
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,577
A chance to reflect and improve.

33
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,411
If you make real progress in meditation...

34
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:11,414
...you'll be realised.

35
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:15,357
You, too! Study to improve yourself!

36
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:33,960
Hey! Hurry up back there!

37
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:35,887
Coming!

38
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,029
Xu Xian...

39
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:52,116
I shouldn't have climbed up here to pick herbs with you.

40
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:53,768
Be a bit more patient.

41
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,398
Look! Here's one!

42
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,929
Unlike Shennong, you know the value of herbs.

43
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,052
Xu Xian, you even know which flowers to eat.

44
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:03,469
Which flowers cure which ailments.

45
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,226
Do you even know what flower that is?

46
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:09,832
That fool is eating flowers! They have thorns!

47
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,384
He's no fool.

48
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:15,115
He's not picking the pretty wild roses with thorns.

49
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:17,161
Roses are pretty...

50
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,302
but not as pretty as me.

51
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:25,912
You...you're more like a hornflower.

52
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:30,747
Blowing your own horn from dawn to dusk.

53
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:32,724
Hey, don't you even know...

54
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,935
Medicines cure some ailments.

55
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:38,035
But others need liquor distiled from flowers!

56
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,155
That's absolutely right!

57
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:42,684
Let's keep going.

58
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:45,447
- Alright - Climb further?

59
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,029
Look, they're still digging for herbs.

60
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,095
They'll strip the whole mountain bare!

61
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,606
I'll give them a scare!

62
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:00,548
What? Qingqing...

63
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:15,890
Xu Xian? Xu Xian?

64
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:58,874
Xu Xian!

65
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,748
He's coming to Xu Xian, are you alright?

66
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:03,613
Xu Xian!

67
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:09,396
Xu Xian!

68
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,606
Where's that girl?

69
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,733
- What girl? - Maybe you banged your head too hard.

70
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,210
Just now, in the water, a girl kissed me.

71
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,104
She breathed into my mouth.

72
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,961
She saved me.

73
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:23,534
Hey! The one giving you the kiss of live was me!

74
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,212
Why did you save him?

75
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:37,795
You even gave his vital energy a boost!

76
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:44,082
Hey, I'm talking to you! What are you staring at?

77
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:47,455
Nothing.

78
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,776
Nothing? You're smitten!

79
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:08,014
Master, it looks like another bat-demon bite.

80
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,795
Amitabha...

81
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,173
- Today is the 15th... - The day of the Lantern Festival.

82
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,827
We have to find these demons soon.

83
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:18,803
Or many more people will die.

84
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,748
Amitabha...

85
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,573
Ferryman, wait!

86
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,836
Here!

87
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:35,615
We need to cross the river, ferryman.

88
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:39,837
I'm no ferryman, but jump in.

89
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:41,116
I hope we're not delaying you.

90
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,272
Not at all! To help others...

91
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,634
...is to spend time well.

92
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,095
Thank you, kind sir.

93
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,380
Sir...

94
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,278
What you just said was very interesting.

95
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:59,676
How do you use your time when you're not helping others?

96
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,378
I'm aiming to become... ...a doctor of medicine.

97
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,636
Good, good! Young men like us should have dreams!

98
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:05,660
I have one too.

99
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:09,467
I dream of become the Abbot of Jinshan Temple.

100
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:10,939
And where would that leave me?

101
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,072
Uh, Master...that's not... I didn't mean now...

102
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,668
- I mean after... - After my death?

103
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,682
- You want me to die? - No, I...I...

104
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:21,401
That's not what I meant, Master...I...

105
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:24,898
I assume you're Abbot Fahai of Jinshan Temple.

106
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,761
It takes ten years of good deeds for two people to meet.

107
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:29,046
It's destiny that let us to be acquainted.

108
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:34,114
- Young man, you're from Hangzhou? - Yes, my name's Xu Xian.

109
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,307
I'm a herbalist.

110
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,724
Master, what are you counting?

111
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,055
How long left until I die.

112
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,696
Xu Xian, the weather's nice today!

113
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,177
- That it is. - Don't change the subject!

114
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,618
- What was your dream again? - No...

115
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,343
The ultimate dream.

116
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,186
I don't have any dream!

117
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:54,876
My only dream is my wish that you...

118
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,050
White, tell us what's bothering you.

119
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:35,754
Turtle and I can help you resolve it.

120
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:40,428
What...do...you...

121
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,737
I want to visit the human world.

122
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:47,290
You just want to see that flower-eating fool!

123
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,469
I'd just like to take another look at him.

124
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,317
Look at what? He's just a common mortal!

125
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:56,026
You've been moping over him for days!

126
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,434
What's this all about?

127
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,840
She used her vital essence to save a fool who was drowning.

128
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:05,198
- If...your...lips... - Let me say it.

129
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,172
If their lips met...

130
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:10,860
...there was a flow of vital essences.

131
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:14,660
He's in you and you're in him!

132
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,761
Nothing so serious, I just want to take a look at him.

133
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:20,769
Don't give me a hard time.

134
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,118
Qingqing, come with me!

135
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,111
Hey, where are you going? I want to come! Take me too!

136
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:28,289
I will just stay here.

137
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,512
See how much fun the mortal world is?

138
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:48,185
In a moment, get off the boat... ...and find him for me.

139
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,832
I'll be strolling around here.

140
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,480
When you find him, bring him to the pavilion on the lake.

141
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,858
Why don't you find him yourself?

142
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:58,018
I want to play a little joke on him.

143
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,384
And see how nice he is.

144
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:07,999
Master, it's turning!

145
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:09,936
Then don't blow on it!

146
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:12,153
We'll split up to look around.

147
00:15:12,614 --> 00:15:13,614
Ah!

148
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:28,719
Watch out!

149
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:30,342
What it is?

150
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,073
A demon!

151
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,862
A demon? How do you know?

152
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:38,547
I'm an expert, of course I know.

153
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:42,632
Are you going to exorcise it?

154
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:46,950
Shh, not so loud! It's nearby!

155
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:48,980
My Master and I have been tracking it for ages.

156
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:51,540
Master says we must exorcise it today.

157
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,799
Why do you have to do that?

158
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,254
Demons hurt people.

159
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,088
What about demons which don't hurt people?

160
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,559
I don't know.

161
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,203
- Could you make friends with them? - Definitely not!

162
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:05,601
Why not?

163
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:09,091
Master only taught me how to exorcise them.

164
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:11,954
Not how to make friends with them.

165
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:18,761
Then your Master has a problem. Or maybe his Master had a problem.

166
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,581
Why don't I have a problem?

167
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:30,272
Because you absolutely don't have one.

168
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:33,896
You're very nice. And very smart.

169
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:36,418
I'd like to have a friend like you.

170
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,029
I'm Qingqing.

171
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,759
I'm Neng Ren.

172
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,704
I'm busy, I have to go.

173
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,684
Take care!

174
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,603
You are the gentleman my sister wants to see.

175
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,450
Look again, do I look like a gentleman?

176
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:22,359
You have the wrong man.

177
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,937
Can't be...

178
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,674
You're a herb-picker, aren't you?

179
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,905
Yes, but I'm not a gentleman.

180
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:36,830
So I can't possibly be the one your sister wants to see.

181
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:43,562
I recognize you, you're the man who eats flowers.

182
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,276
Then what's my name?

183
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,248
Who am I?

184
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,698
I don't know.

185
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:55,344
But you are the one my sister wants to see.

186
00:17:56,068 --> 00:18:00,006
It's Lantern Festival night, go and enjoy it.

187
00:18:00,448 --> 00:18:01,879
And stop bothering me.

188
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,868
Goodnight...young miss.

189
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:12,568
What on earth?

190
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:25,932
Why is it moving?

191
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,626
Stop!

192
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,892
You're a real fool.

193
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:36,067
Where do you think you're going?

194
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,919
Sorry! Sorry! I didn't do that on purpose!

195
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:03,102
Sit down.

196
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,019
Miss, it's late and you're here alone.

197
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:08,940
This isn't proper.

198
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:11,601
Don't treat me as a stranger.

199
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,443
You don't need to be so polite.

200
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:18,420
No, no, I should go.

201
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,522
Who built this pavilion? It's so rickety.

202
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:24,122
Well, I think it's very nice.

203
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:27,438
And it's a perfect spot to see the West Lake.

204
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,295
I'm afraid I'm not so interested.

205
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,974
And I need to get home.

206
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:33,242
This early?

207
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:37,908
There's moonlight on the lake, a pavilion in the moonlight...

208
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:40,693
And we're in the pavilion.

209
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:44,306
Don't you think it's romantic?

210
00:20:44,335 --> 00:20:46,300
I'm too busy for romance.

211
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:49,002
What are you avoiding?

212
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:51,402
Why are keeping such a distance from me?

213
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,026
Why don't you like me?

214
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:57,340
It's not that I don't like you, Miss.

215
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:02,881
But someone else already has my heart.

216
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:13,527
Miss, I'm a very poor man.

217
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:16,157
I pick herbs for a living.

218
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,145
I'm not worthy of your affections.

219
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,590
Then tell me about her.

220
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,874
What kind of person is she?

221
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,120
I know almost nothing about her.

222
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:38,649
I can't even recall her face.

223
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,622
All I know is that she saved my life.

224
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:49,162
That day I fell into a lake in the mountains.

225
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,928
She rescued me.

226
00:21:56,998 --> 00:22:00,954
If she saved your life, you owe her a lot.

227
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:04,934
But when I revived...

228
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:07,419
...she was gone.

229
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:10,220
My friends said I'd imagined her.

230
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:14,767
But I'm quite sure... ...she was real.

231
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:19,963
Because she kissed me so deeply...

232
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:24,515
That kiss saved my life.

233
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:29,152
In a way, it also took my life.

234
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:35,802
What if... You could kiss her again?

235
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,485
Would you remember her this time?

236
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,399
Hello, my friend!

237
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,325
Oh, it's you...haven't gone home yet?

238
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,677
Done with your errands?

239
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,599
All done.

240
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,660
It's dangerous here, you should go home.

241
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,579
If it's dangerous, you should leave too.

242
00:24:13,614 --> 00:24:16,192
I can't, I'm hunting demons.

243
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,773
Know the saying?

244
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:21,209
"There's someone smarter than you know."

245
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:25,027
It applies to the demons too.

246
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,516
You're no match for this one.

247
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:30,271
I advise you to give up.

248
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,896
I can't, I sworn to obey my Master.

249
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,035
We have to trap the bat-demon tonight.

250
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,603
Well, if you want to kill yourself...

251
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:47,468
This is a very, very powerful demon.

252
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,891
Not really...

253
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:55,673
Just a bat-demon which bit a girl.

254
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,782
Ugh, she's all bloody!

255
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,083
How do you know?

256
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:02,916
I am an expert too.

257
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,726
I can't let it get away.

258
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:12,660
Sorry we can't talk more, until next time!

259
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:14,990
No!

260
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,639
Watch out!

261
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:22,042
Oh well, there goes another friend.

262
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,872
Neng Ren of Jinshan Temple!

263
00:25:24,877 --> 00:25:27,857
Demon hunter and enforcer of Buddha's Law.

264
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,056
No bluffing!

265
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:39,665
Master! Save me!

266
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:45,145
Master...

267
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:52,958
Master! Save me!

268
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,221
Master!

269
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,805
Master!

270
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,286
Look! Master Fahai and Neng Ren are back!

271
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:17,982
What's wrong with Brother Neng Ren?

272
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:19,411
The bat-demon poisoned him.

273
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:21,143
Can he be cured?

274
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:24,831
If he's lucky...

275
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:45,083
What are you staring at?

276
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,263
You...

277
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,451
No need to keep staring so long.

278
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:52,881
I can't stop wondering...

279
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,469
...if this is really happening.

280
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:59,002
What do you think?

281
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,148
That you're dreaming?

282
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,541
Someone once told me...

283
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:09,007
If I want to see someone, I should keep her in my heart.

284
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:11,287
Then I'll really see her again.

285
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:15,499
Now I know it isn't superstition, it's true.

286
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:25,817
You're saying you did want to see me again.

287
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:34,103
Xu Xian, let's go on like this.

288
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,529
Always together, alright?

289
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:41,978
Eating together, sleeping together...

290
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:43,570
Doing everything together.

291
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,545
Won't you get tired of me?

292
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,304
Won't you?

293
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,920
But I want to take you seriously.

294
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:59,021
I want to meet your parents.

295
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:02,631
And when I have their permission to court you...

296
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:08,226
Then we'll have a formal match and get married?

297
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,239
Brother! Brother!

298
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:26,000
Wake up!

299
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:28,457
The sun rose hours ago!

300
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,687
Brother, wake up!

301
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,057
What?

302
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:35,072
That's scary, Brother!

303
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:38,026
Brother! You...Your ears have grown pointy!

304
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:41,262
And you got fangs! So scary!

305
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:45,245
Brother, are you turning into a demon?

306
00:31:56,722 --> 00:32:00,732
Master! Master! Something very bad happened!

307
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,273
Brother Neng Ren has run away.

308
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:07,337
Come end see! Quickly!

309
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:18,130
This place isn't bad, we could live here.

310
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:20,302
Change!

311
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:28,653
Hey, friend...

312
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:31,640
You want to hang yourself?

313
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:34,989
Hurry away, friend.

314
00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:37,701
Death by hanging is an ugly sight.

315
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:39,163
You'll get nightmares.

316
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:41,714
I know!

317
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:44,288
After death, your body turns purple...

318
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:47,368
Your tongue hangs loose and your eyes fall out!

319
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:48,715
What?

320
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,145
If you don't believe me, give it a go!

321
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,796
You don't look like you really want to die.

322
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,120
You don't understand.

323
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:09,022
I'm a demon hunter...

324
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:12,427
...but I'm turning into a demon!

325
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:14,105
Just think...

326
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,410
When I meet a demon I've hunted before...

327
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,166
...I will seriously lose face.

328
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:23,858
If you're a demon, just be a demon.

329
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:25,104
When one demon meets another...

330
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,974
...mostly they just nod a greeting.

331
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,873
And lots of them don't have limbs.

332
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,053
Who'll care about your face?

333
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:35,891
I'll let you in on a secret.

334
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:40,520
Actually, I'm a demon too.

335
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,248
You...you...

336
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,848
What's wrong?

337
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,756
Aren't we the same now?

338
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:54,649
All demons together! Don't look at me like that!

339
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:58,360
Since we are so close now...

340
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:01,895
...I'll teach you how to be a demon.

341
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,957
Come on!

342
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,108
I'm gelded!

343
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,838
- Come on! - A gelding!

344
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:13,135
I just had chive for breakfast. I am going to throw up!

345
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:19,561
- Bats hang upside-down, get used to it! - My head will burst! It's full of blood!

346
00:34:20,747 --> 00:34:23,366
That will make you smarter.

347
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:26,424
I have a question for you. Am I pretty?

348
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:27,910
Listen...

349
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:30,557
Right now, all I can see is stars.

350
00:34:30,592 --> 00:34:33,773
I'm seeing you upside-down.

351
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:37,290
- Pretty doesn't come out into it. - I see.

352
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:46,216
And now, am I pretty?

353
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:50,119
Seeing you now... very pretty.

354
00:34:51,352 --> 00:34:56,371
So, do you get a special feeling when you look at me?

355
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,042
Would you like to bite my neck?

356
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:06,666
Taste my blood?

357
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:14,951
Amitabha...

358
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:15,982
I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner.

359
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:17,824
Drink some water.

360
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:27,006
What's this?

361
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,545
What do you think?

362
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,272
You bit my neck...

363
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:32,642
...ate meat and drank blood!

364
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:33,732
You violated the Three Taboos!

365
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:35,801
No more calling yourself a monk!

366
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:38,915
From now on, be the demon you are!

367
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,722
Liar!

368
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:50,942
We're there. Have we brought enough gifts?

369
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:53,530
Stop worrying! Come on in.

370
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,769
I didn't expect your family to live in a mansion!

371
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:02,319
It's just a broken-down old house.

372
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:05,883
You're here at last! You kept us waiting!

373
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:10,337
They're all here... this is my family.

374
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:11,782
Go on in.

375
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:14,022
- Go ahead - Thanks.

376
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,278
We need to hurry.

377
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:19,794
They can't keep these forms for long.

378
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,158
I know.

379
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:23,722
I want to play too!

380
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:26,501
You can't take a human form! Scram!

381
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,732
Hello, everyone.

382
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,588
I'll make the introductions.

383
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,984
This is my father.

384
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:50,098
Hello.

385
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,489
Sir, my name is Xu Xian.

386
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,218
- He's... - He's absolutely amazing!

387
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:02,446
- You're... - You're just perfect for each other!

388
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,797
The perfect couple!

389
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:07,636
- Really... - Really nice to see!

390
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,015
How wonderful that you are here to propose!

391
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:15,241
- Don't worry, he's fine. - Auspicious day for an engagement, isn't it?

392
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:20,249
This is...my mother.

393
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,484
- She's so young! - Really?

394
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:25,316
Actually, my stepmother.

395
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,904
I'll introduce you...

396
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:31,874
Googie...Googie...

397
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:36,524
How come you have a girl's name?

398
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,683
You misheard, it's Gugu.

399
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:42,773
He was a chubby kid, that was his nickname.

400
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:45,211
And it stuck.

401
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,865
- Hello, Gugu. - Let's sit down.

402
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,583
It's this year's latest fashion.

403
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,741
This is called Doodle-do Wine.

404
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,176
It'll make you hiccup! Doodle-do!

405
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:16,944
My parents like you to look at them when you speak.

406
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:20,586
Aren't you here today to propose?

407
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:23,228
Hurry then, we can hardly wait.

408
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,749
I'm Xu Xian, poor and humble

409
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:37,117
I never dreamt I'd win anyone like your Susu.

410
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:45,435
I've come here today...

411
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,694
...because I seek your exalted permission...

412
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,437
...to marry Susu.

413
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,015
Sir...

414
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,219
Although I have nothing to my name...

415
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,696
...I love Susu very much.

416
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,032
No need for a dowry, just take her home! Go on!

417
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:06,167
I also want to say to Susu...

418
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,118
Good heavens!

419
00:39:09,262 --> 00:39:11,959
Fine, just get on with it!

420
00:39:12,194 --> 00:39:14,417
I want to hear what Xu Xian has to say.

421
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,896
Sister...

422
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,754
Speak.

423
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,002
I don't know what stroke of good fortune...

424
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:27,913
...allows me to make you mine.

425
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,108
All it took was one kiss.

426
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:31,893
The wheels of fate turned...

427
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:34,487
...and brought me to a perfect moment...

428
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:38,033
...of tenderness and happiness.

429
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:41,145
From now on every moment, every second I have...

430
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,654
...I will spend...

431
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,606
...beside you...

432
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:50,107
To make you happy.

433
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,594
- Why did you do that? - They're reverting to their true forms.

434
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:06,881
It's bad! It's bad!

435
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:09,348
Fahai is here to exorcise us! Run!

436
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,242
Run!

437
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:16,345
Get Xu Xian away from here while I distract him.

438
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:17,690
Take Care!

439
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:24,407
A tawdry illusion to dupe humans!

440
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:31,648
Send them all back to the demon realm!

441
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:33,070
Yes, Master!

442
00:41:48,894 --> 00:41:50,778
Master!

443
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:55,575
Master, let her go!

444
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,470
Do you know what you're saying?

445
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:01,013
Come back with me.

446
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:03,094
Master...

447
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:07,606
I can't go back anymore.

448
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:20,363
Master, take care!

449
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,114
We escaped?

450
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,068
I'm not dead?

451
00:43:05,103 --> 00:43:08,445
Be calm, I'll always protect you.

452
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:38,505
What are we doing here?

453
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:40,620
Weren't we getting engaged?

454
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,110
We did it.

455
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:45,528
My parents gave us their blessing.

456
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:47,112
- Really? - Yes.

457
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,377
That was easy.

458
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:51,444
So now we're married.

459
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:53,862
I'm your wife.

460
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:57,032
We can be together for the rest of our lives.

461
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:00,958
One day...

462
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:03,588
...I'll have my own pharmacy.

463
00:44:03,723 --> 00:44:05,598
Then I'll have more money.

464
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,735
I don't want you to suffer with me.

465
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:12,973
How could that be?

466
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:14,804
As long as we're together...

467
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:18,419
...I'll never know suffering.

468
00:44:57,324 --> 00:45:00,578
What's love like in this human world?

469
00:45:01,013 --> 00:45:03,024
What do you mean?

470
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,954
I'd just like to know what kind of couple we are.

471
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,884
Tell me.

472
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:11,871
Well, there are several kinds.

473
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:15,637
Some couples are like birds in the forest.

474
00:45:15,692 --> 00:45:17,483
Each can fly away if they want.

475
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:19,466
Not that kind!

476
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:21,277
Another kind is...

477
00:45:21,712 --> 00:45:22,896
...where the husband gets rich and dreams...

478
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:24,354
...of his wife's death.

479
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,243
Xu Xian! I'll kill you!

480
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,387
Watch out!

481
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:32,037
Don't chase me!

482
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:35,877
- You'll make me drop the herbs! - I'll kill you!

483
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,988
This disease cannot be cured.

484
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:51,443
- Master! - They are victims of demons.

485
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:57,427
At best, they'll go mad... at worst, they'll die.

486
00:46:57,825 --> 00:47:01,438
While they're alive, I must try to save them.

487
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:06,907
Take precautions, don't go to strange places alone.

488
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,658
Thank you, Master.

489
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:14,191
Where did this disease come from?

490
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:15,968
So many people suddenly dying.

491
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,924
You should take some rest.

492
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:19,501
You've been taking medicine for three days!

493
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,795
I can't.

494
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:25,453
I have to find the cure.

495
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:28,533
Susu, give me a hand.

496
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:31,694
It musn't stick... ...to the bottom of the pot.

497
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:36,797
Preserving vital essence,

498
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:37,928
concentrating vigor,

499
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,631
boosting the spirit.

500
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:41,398
Aside from these fundamentals...

501
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:44,794
...the medicine must strenghten basic functions.

502
00:47:45,264 --> 00:47:47,303
This is such a fierce disease.

503
00:47:47,538 --> 00:47:49,214
Can this medicine work?

504
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:51,493
I don't really know.

505
00:47:56,961 --> 00:48:00,131
Woman...

506
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:46,313
Disciples!

507
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:25,416
Foul demons! Crossing the three realms and five planes...

508
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:28,811
...you harmed the people and spread chaos and evil!

509
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:31,553
By Buddha's mercy, if you choose to repent...

510
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:34,226
...you still have a chance to live.

511
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:38,859
We'd rather die than listen to your nonsense!

512
00:50:07,453 --> 00:50:09,555
Beware! The fox-demons are casting a charm!

513
00:50:09,689 --> 00:50:11,723
- On guard! - Yes, Master!

514
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:16,485
Maximum protection shield!

515
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,087
Heaven needs no hearing ecstasy, needs no sight.

516
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:22,624
Void my sense of self.

517
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:06,248
What's that mantra?

518
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:10,642
Is it real or are you making it up?

519
00:51:21,772 --> 00:51:23,435
Show your real forms!

520
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,988
By heaven's mercy.

521
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:54,413
Master, we regret our sin.

522
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:56,887
Please let us go. We beg you.

523
00:51:57,275 --> 00:51:59,176
Silence! You are demons!

524
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:01,323
Return to the six oaths of transmigration!

525
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:03,759
Accept your punishment with humility!

526
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:06,790
Amitabha...

527
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,056
Sister, Sister.

528
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,070
What's wrong? Are you alright?

529
00:52:28,055 --> 00:52:29,090
It's nothing.

530
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,711
That's impossible...

531
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:33,255
If you keep on like this...

532
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,799
...something will go very wrong.

533
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,698
I know what I'm doing.

534
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:40,094
All you care about is that Xu Xian.

535
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:41,848
Adding your vital essence to that medicine...

536
00:52:41,883 --> 00:52:45,176
...is costing you centuries of self-improvement.

537
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,468
I don't want to see him work so hard. I want to help him.

538
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:52,382
But you may not live to see him again!

539
00:52:52,617 --> 00:52:55,549
- It can't be that bad. - Of course it is.

540
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:57,551
I have to go.

541
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:01,882
Wait!

542
00:53:03,152 --> 00:53:06,907
- Ah, Dr. Xu is here. - Dr. Xu, thank you!

543
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:10,750
- You're truly our savior. - We owe you our lives.

544
00:53:11,185 --> 00:53:14,271
You and your wife are such good people.

545
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:17,020
Don't rush.

546
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:20,048
There's enough for everyone.

547
00:53:20,712 --> 00:53:21,940
Thank you.

548
00:53:22,554 --> 00:53:24,468
Master, you should take some too.

549
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:27,799
It cures sickness and prevents infection.

550
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,706
Thank you.

551
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:36,239
Master...

552
00:53:36,274 --> 00:53:37,601
Did you mix this medicine?

553
00:53:37,636 --> 00:53:38,798
Yes.

554
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:42,397
- No one helped you? - Yes, my wife did.

555
00:53:42,732 --> 00:53:45,522
You are the quintessence of benevolence.

556
00:53:45,757 --> 00:53:48,801
Take this spirit dagger as a token of thanks.

557
00:53:48,886 --> 00:53:50,819
I can't, Master. I'm just doing my duty.

558
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:52,827
You shouldn't refuse a gift from a senior.

559
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,994
Keep it to protect yourself.

560
00:53:56,183 --> 00:53:58,670
Thank you, Master.

561
00:53:58,826 --> 00:54:00,958
Amitabha...

562
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:33,437
You think you can run?

563
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:32,363
You made the cure for the fox-demon's poison.

564
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:34,211
So what?

565
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:37,627
Making it has cost you centuries of vital essence.

566
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:41,484
You're kind to the ordinary people.

567
00:55:41,649 --> 00:55:45,189
But in your eyes, all we do is harm people.

568
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:47,827
Despite good intentions, you will harm someone.

569
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:49,012
Who will I harm?

570
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:50,367
You should know that.

571
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:53,429
Xu Xian is my true love, how could I harm him?

572
00:55:53,664 --> 00:55:56,068
You're from different realms! Being together...

573
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,481
...you drain his life-force and distort his destiny.

574
00:55:58,516 --> 00:56:01,785
Human lives are short, and true love is rare.

575
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,953
He didn't choose to love you, you took his love.

576
00:56:04,188 --> 00:56:07,567
What does that matter? He's happy with me.

577
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:09,844
Go chant your sutras!

578
00:56:09,879 --> 00:56:12,738
You know nothing of love.

579
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:16,111
If Xu Xian knew you are a snake...

580
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:18,867
...would he still love you?

581
00:56:22,863 --> 00:56:25,806
I truly love him.

582
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:31,517
If that's the case, shed your own tears.

583
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:34,293
Don't make him shed tears over you.

584
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:41,589
Since you're so benevolent...

585
00:56:41,824 --> 00:56:44,272
...I'll let you go this time.

586
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:49,505
If I see you again in this realm, there'll be no mercy.

587
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,205
Susu, I'm home.

588
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:15,984
So soon?

589
00:57:18,545 --> 00:57:19,686
You're back ...

590
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:22,358
Look!

591
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:24,015
What's special about today?

592
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,143
Well, everyone else...

593
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:27,527
...is celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival.

594
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:28,561
While I'm celebrating...

595
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:30,900
...the best day I've ever had!

596
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:34,905
The day my medicine cured everyone!

597
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,746
- Really? - Yes.

598
00:57:36,895 --> 00:57:38,550
That's wonderful.

599
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:42,476
The old villagers were so grateful. They gave us all this food.

600
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:45,719
Susu, thank you for working so hard.

601
00:57:45,854 --> 00:57:49,048
Here, a toast to you.

602
00:57:56,912 --> 00:58:00,135
I'm hungry. Here, try this.

603
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:06,905
It's good.

604
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,505
You have some too.

605
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:14,282
What's wrong?

606
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:18,138
What kind of wine is this?

607
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:20,989
They distiled it themselves.

608
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:23,898
Sulphur-flower wine!

609
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,781
That's right.

610
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:29,701
It's a festival tradition, it wards off snake bites.

611
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:32,806
Susu?

612
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:36,373
What's wrong? Susu!

613
00:58:36,835 --> 00:58:39,700
Susu? Susu? What's the matter?

614
00:58:39,735 --> 00:58:41,124
Are you alright?

615
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,933
I'm alright.

616
00:58:43,326 --> 00:58:44,690
Susu!

617
00:58:45,314 --> 00:58:48,019
Why lock the door? Open it!

618
00:58:48,389 --> 00:58:49,077
Susu...

619
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:51,423
Don't frighten me!

620
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:53,312
Susu...

621
00:58:55,023 --> 00:58:56,686
What's the matter?

622
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:58,115
Susu!

623
00:58:58,624 --> 00:59:01,053
Susu!

624
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:14,737
Susu!

625
00:59:15,272 --> 00:59:17,594
Susu, what are you doing?

626
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,497
Open the door!

627
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:22,640
Susu, don't frighten me!

628
00:59:23,706 --> 00:59:24,840
Xu Xian...

629
00:59:24,976 --> 00:59:26,488
Do you recall...

630
00:59:27,122 --> 00:59:29,471
...what you said to me when you proposed?

631
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:32,157
I want to hear you saying it again.

632
00:59:33,255 --> 00:59:35,894
I knew you were playing a trick on me!

633
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:37,724
I'd rather not repeat it.

634
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:39,975
If you don't...

635
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:41,799
...I might never hear it again.

636
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:45,035
Alright, alright I'll say it.

637
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,565
But then you must open the door!

638
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:53,018
Alright.

639
00:59:55,481 --> 00:59:57,980
"All it took was one kiss."

640
00:59:58,215 --> 01:00:01,813
"I'm sure that the wheels of fate turned..."

641
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:05,131
"...and brought me to a perfect moment..."

642
01:00:05,466 --> 01:00:09,887
"...of tenderness and happiness."

643
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:13,965
"From now on..."

644
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:17,392
"...every moment, every second I have..."

645
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:21,587
"...I will spend beside you..."

646
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:27,491
"...to make you happy."

647
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:34,098
Susu! Susu!

648
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:37,128
Open the door, Susu!

649
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,256
I gave you a chance.

650
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:46,302
You didn't leave, so now I must take you.

651
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:49,991
Monk...Why are you intent on destroying our happiness?

652
01:00:50,026 --> 01:00:52,489
Susu! Who are you talking to?

653
01:01:41,103 --> 01:01:42,678
Don't chase her!

654
01:01:43,213 --> 01:01:44,538
She was stabbed with the spirit dagger.

655
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:47,832
Losing vital essence, she can't take human form.

656
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:52,050
Master, where is my wife?

657
01:01:52,832 --> 01:01:55,126
Did the white snake eat her?

658
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:57,203
The white snake was your wife.

659
01:01:57,238 --> 01:02:00,423
You married a thousand-year-old snake demon.

660
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,633
Impossible!

661
01:02:08,221 --> 01:02:10,156
Impossible!

662
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:14,319
- Impossible! - Amitabha...

663
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:04,651
Sister, I'll give you some of my vital essence.

664
01:03:06,531 --> 01:03:08,201
It's no use.

665
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:14,643
You have only a few centuries' worth.

666
01:03:14,678 --> 01:03:20,629
That spirit dagger had thousands!

667
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:26,966
We were wrong to come here.

668
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:32,038
It wasn't worth it, to see you like this.

669
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:39,401
Maybe I shouldn't have done it...

670
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:44,509
But I have no regrets.

671
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:50,087
Only now do I know...

672
01:03:50,847 --> 01:03:53,845
...what true love is.

673
01:03:56,990 --> 01:03:58,905
Love...

674
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:02,097
Is it really so important?

675
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:07,864
Tell me...

676
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:10,960
How can I save Susu?

677
01:04:12,027 --> 01:04:13,709
The one thing that might is spirit herb.

678
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,921
It can bring the dead back to life.

679
01:04:15,932 --> 01:04:21,032
It only grows in the Lei Feng Pagoda.

680
01:04:21,533 --> 01:04:24,024
A demon like me can't even get in there!

681
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,118
Plus, there is only a single sprout.

682
01:04:27,183 --> 01:04:31,278
It is really, really scary. They say fire can't even burn it!

683
01:04:32,153 --> 01:04:35,130
Even if it takes braving swords and seas of fire...

684
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:38,676
...I shall save Susu.

685
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,089
I can't take you any further.

686
01:06:46,343 --> 01:06:52,288
You dare to steal the spirit herb? Thief!

687
01:07:06,652 --> 01:07:09,752
Which is the real spirit herb?

688
01:07:10,186 --> 01:07:13,292
You will know after your death.

689
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:17,245
I'll find it even if it kills me!

690
01:07:18,828 --> 01:07:21,741
I must save Susu!

691
01:07:29,348 --> 01:07:33,213
There's only a single sprout. Fire can't even burn it!

692
01:09:04,593 --> 01:09:06,043
They found us!

693
01:09:16,296 --> 01:09:17,831
- Did you get the spirit herb? - I did.

694
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,258
Then let's get out of here!

695
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,355
It is going to be disaster if they catch you.

696
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,928
You take the spirit herb, I'll distract them.

697
01:09:57,827 --> 01:10:01,326
Demons have been confined in Lei Feng Pagoda for aeons!

698
01:10:01,861 --> 01:10:04,059
The spirit herb kept them trapped.

699
01:10:04,144 --> 01:10:07,231
Your theft has caused a catastrophe!

700
01:10:07,816 --> 01:10:11,046
Let me go! Why are you keeping me here?

701
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:12,743
I needed to save her!

702
01:10:12,978 --> 01:10:14,479
I wounded Susu.

703
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:17,798
Master, let me go! Let me go!

704
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,196
I wounded Susu.

705
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,667
Master, we can't hold them much longer.

706
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:28,056
Call all the senior monks, now!

707
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:30,474
We'll cast the Luohan spell!

708
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,345
I got spirit herb!

709
01:10:42,886 --> 01:10:45,051
Spirit herb? From where?

710
01:10:45,185 --> 01:10:47,219
Xu Xian gave it to me.

711
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:49,182
Where is he?

712
01:10:50,436 --> 01:10:53,216
The monks took him.

713
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:33,257
Disciples!

714
01:11:33,432 --> 01:11:36,514
Seal the main hall with a maximum protection spell!

715
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:46,853
Maximum protection in force!

716
01:11:47,788 --> 01:11:50,619
Now we cast the spell!

717
01:11:50,654 --> 01:11:53,352
Any interruption will kill him!

718
01:12:23,718 --> 01:12:26,390
Leave! You trespass on hallowed ground!

719
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,271
Fahai, give me Xu Xian!

720
01:12:28,406 --> 01:12:31,124
You should be thankful you aren't dead.

721
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:32,829
Why this further trouble?

722
01:12:32,924 --> 01:12:35,645
Release him and I'll go at once.

723
01:12:35,681 --> 01:12:37,817
He stole the spirit herb for you.

724
01:12:37,852 --> 01:12:40,157
He's in great danger because evil spirits possessed him!

725
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:42,995
Now we're breaking your spell!

726
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:45,602
I possessed him? That cannot be...

727
01:12:45,697 --> 01:12:46,768
I want to see him.

728
01:12:46,843 --> 01:12:50,071
He's in a life-or-death struggle. Interrupting the ritual...

729
01:12:50,306 --> 01:12:51,518
...will end his life...

730
01:12:51,553 --> 01:12:54,281
...and threaten those around him.

731
01:12:54,616 --> 01:12:57,603
Relations between humans and demons can bring no good.

732
01:12:57,738 --> 01:12:58,927
You...

733
01:12:59,062 --> 01:13:02,635
You're just coming between my sister and Xu Xian!

734
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,156
If you won't release him, I'll fight you!

735
01:14:08,638 --> 01:14:11,769
If I don't leave with Xu Xian, I'll flood Jinshan!

736
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:15,309
You are selfish! How many lives will you threaten?

737
01:14:15,349 --> 01:14:19,104
I will be force to put an end to you unless you stop.

738
01:14:19,139 --> 01:14:23,059
Very well... You're forcing me!

739
01:15:43,394 --> 01:15:45,808
Get the important ones first!

740
01:15:45,886 --> 01:15:47,824
Quick!

741
01:18:31,576 --> 01:18:37,487
Forward, brothers! Charge!

742
01:18:40,518 --> 01:18:43,086
Bite them! Break their human chain!

743
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:27,059
Xu Xian! Xu Xian!

744
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:46,849
Xu Xian?

745
01:19:48,061 --> 01:19:49,187
You...

746
01:19:50,739 --> 01:19:52,668
It's me, Susu.

747
01:19:53,032 --> 01:19:54,454
Susu?

748
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:02,593
Who is Susu?

749
01:20:07,914 --> 01:20:10,482
I'm your wife.

750
01:20:11,157 --> 01:20:12,963
When did I get married?

751
01:20:13,538 --> 01:20:16,149
Do you remember how we met?

752
01:20:18,298 --> 01:20:19,378
I...

753
01:20:24,755 --> 01:20:29,646
Fahai, what horrible magic did you use to make him forget me?

754
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,385
As I told you, evil spirits possessed him.

755
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,697
You broke in and disrupted the Luohan spell!

756
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:39,064
You're the one who's harmed Xu Xian!

757
01:20:39,098 --> 01:20:42,825
What Luohan spell? What possession?

758
01:20:42,861 --> 01:20:45,117
You're making it up!

759
01:20:45,152 --> 01:20:48,080
You just want Xu Xian to leave me.

760
01:20:48,214 --> 01:20:50,435
You're a monster!

761
01:22:14,049 --> 01:22:15,129
Qingqing!

762
01:23:14,945 --> 01:23:16,400
Brother Neng Ren!

763
01:23:22,876 --> 01:23:28,360
Brother Neng Ren!

764
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,187
I've been a dharma defender all my life...

765
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:44,849
...to maintain natural order and ethical conduct.

766
01:23:45,482 --> 01:23:49,280
Why did the calamity happen instead?

767
01:23:50,815 --> 01:23:53,237
Have I been too stubborn?

768
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:58,788
Was I really wrong?

769
01:24:25,295 --> 01:24:27,758
Why is it...

770
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:31,761
...that every time I wake up...

771
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:35,789
...you're beside me?

772
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:03,301
Open the door! Let me out!

773
01:28:03,837 --> 01:28:06,237
Let me see Xu Xian one more time!

774
01:28:06,472 --> 01:28:10,387
I don't care if you turn me to dust and scatter me.

775
01:28:21,402 --> 01:28:25,315
The love we had... Was it not real?

776
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:32,262
Where is all your great benevolence now?

777
01:28:39,892 --> 01:28:42,857
Can't we see each other just one more?

778
01:28:47,518 --> 01:28:49,703
Just once...

779
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,651
I'll accept my punishment.

780
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,660
Amitabha...

781
01:29:33,716 --> 01:29:35,666
Your mercy is boundless...

782
01:29:37,144 --> 01:29:39,312
I understand...

783
01:29:39,891 --> 01:29:43,036
Amitabha...

784
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,903
Xu Xian!

785
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:21,170
You're suffering...

786
01:30:21,904 --> 01:30:24,334
I don't recognize you...

787
01:30:25,395 --> 01:30:27,693
...but for some reason I don't understand...

788
01:30:28,927 --> 01:30:32,413
...when I see you shedding tears...

789
01:30:32,657 --> 01:30:34,752
...my heart aches for you.

790
01:30:40,322 --> 01:30:45,159
Don't be upset, I don't want you to cry.

791
01:30:45,942 --> 01:30:48,708
I'll cry for both of us.

792
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:53,916
I don't mind that you've forgotten me.

793
01:30:55,357 --> 01:30:58,194
My own memories are enough.

794
01:30:58,595 --> 01:31:01,626
Before I first saw you...

795
01:31:01,641 --> 01:31:04,711
...I meditated for a thousand years.

796
01:31:06,524 --> 01:31:08,687
But those thousand years...

797
01:31:10,211 --> 01:31:14,701
...were worth less than a moment with you.

798
01:31:16,534 --> 01:31:18,798
You'll never know...

799
01:31:20,614 --> 01:31:25,662
...how I've had to suffer.

800
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,627
But even if I die...

801
01:31:29,619 --> 01:31:32,342
...I'll have no regrets.

802
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:19,418
Susu...

803
01:32:30,162 --> 01:32:34,291
<i>Your hair tickles my heart</i>

804
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:37,055
<i>Your eyes lingers in my mind</i>

805
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:40,835
<i>I can bear any hardships to be with you</i>

806
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:45,203
<i>Our love shall remain in the dark</i>

807
01:32:45,438 --> 01:32:48,205
<i>year after year</i>

808
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,084
<i>but nothing can change it</i>

809
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:51,222
<i>Nothing at all</i>

810
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:53,501
<i>I will be there</i>

811
01:32:53,636 --> 01:32:56,217
<i>If you are there</i>

812
01:32:56,553 --> 01:33:03,037
<i>I vow to live for you</i>

813
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:09,853
<i>Because I can lose anthing but you</i>

814
01:33:09,988 --> 01:33:12,646
<i>Love is right</i>

815
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:16,645
<i>If there is joy between us</i>

816
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:19,884
<i>Our love shall survive</i>

817
01:33:19,919 --> 01:33:23,850
<i>longer than any time</i>

818
01:33:24,085 --> 01:33:29,267
<i>I vow to live for you</i>

819
01:33:29,302 --> 01:33:31,098
<i>till the end of time</i>

820
01:33:31,133 --> 01:33:36,310
<i>Because I can lose anything but you</i>

821
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:40,388
<i>Love is right</i>

822
01:33:40,424 --> 01:33:44,171
<i>If the tortures on me are to protect you</i>

823
01:33:44,206 --> 01:33:47,204
<i>Our love shall survive</i>

824
01:33:47,339 --> 01:33:52,134
<i>longer than any time</i>

825
01:33:52,537 --> 01:33:58,133
<i>And we'll meet again in our next lives</i>

826
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:03,349
Susu...

827
01:34:12,652 --> 01:34:18,097
For the two of them, that was probably the best outcome.

828
01:34:20,331 --> 01:34:24,701
I never want to love anyone as she loved him.

829
01:34:24,736 --> 01:34:29,892
You...you'll never be much good as a demon.

830
01:35:29,397 --> 01:35:30,705
Neng Ren...

831
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:32,551
that new form you have...

832
01:35:33,037 --> 01:35:34,637
It kind of suits you.
